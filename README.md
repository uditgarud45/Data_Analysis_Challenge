EU Countries with Highest Average Takings per Customer
This Python script analyzes customer payment data to determine which EU countries have the highest average takings per customer. The script processes the data and generates a chart and a CSV/Excel file for further analysis.

How to Use
1) Ensure you have the necessary data files: payment.csv, address.csv, city.csv, country.csv, and customer.csv.
Run the Python script.
2) The script will compute the average sales per customer for each country and identify the EU countries with the highest average takings.
3) A horizontal bar chart will be generated to visualize the results, highlighting the EU countries with the highest average takings per customer.
4) The chart will be saved as a PDF file named avg_eu_sales.pdf.
5) The data will be exported to a CSV file named avg_country_customer_eu.csv and an Excel file named avg_country_customer_eu.xlsx.
Feel free to customize the script according to your needs and data sources.
